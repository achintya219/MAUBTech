We have added a page for company login that has a roster of candidates to be interviewed on the left and details required by the company on the right. We intend to build a service that helps in scheduling interviews of multiple companies for a particular university. The scheduling will also incorporate dynamic changes, such as delays and revises the entire schedule; notifying all the people affected. 

The other pages are a work in progress! :)
